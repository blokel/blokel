Blokel
========

Blokel is a game inspired by Cube World. Its goal is to make a game that has RPG elements like Cube World, but have that voxel experience that Minecraft has. As well as to have tons of exploration features provided in Terraria and Minecraft. Nonetheless, we accept hate comments calling it a Minecraft clone, a 3D terraria clone, and a Cube World clone, because that is exactly what it is.
Blokel is not released, but you can compile the current source to see the progress so far, with instructions below.

Source based on Minetest <minetest.net>

In case you downloaded the source code:
---------------------------------------
If you downloaded the Blokel Engine source code in which this file is
contained, you probably want to download the blokel_game project too:
  https://github.com/blokel/blokel_game/
See the README.txt in it. (this adds features to the game, rather than it be a minimal test)

This game is not finished

Compiling
--------------------------------------
Currently, Blokel is only supported on Linux based operating systems. All compile instructions are the same as Minetest. So if there are no instructions for your current distro, google it for Minetest.

Ubuntu:
- Create a .sh file with the script from http://pastebin.com/j6tmWKNg
- Goto terminal, and goto the directory with script inside of it, and chmod the file so you can run it. (chmod +x)
- Type ./compilescript.sh (it can be named anything, but compilescript.sh is an example)

Fedora:
- Create a .sh file with the script from http://pastebin.com/QepTnwGt
- Goto terminal, and goto the directory with the script inside of it, and chmod the file so you can run it. (chmod +x)
- Type ./compilescript.sh (it can be named anything, but compilescript.sh is an example)
- If there are errors, install the dependencies found in the script manually and then compile it.



Note:
- This game is not even closed to being finished, so the only way you can play is by compiling the source yourself. 
- Do not expect this to be perfect. It will be buggy, sometimes slow, and even not work at all.
